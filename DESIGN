General
+++++++
The chunky block storage system has two components:
  1. blockmaster
     The purpose of the blockmaster is to store all system metadata. This
     includes all active blockservers, all stored blocks, and which servers
     store which blocks.

  2. blockserver
     The blockserver handles receiving block data, storing it, and serving it
     back when requested. The blockserver also handles the meat of data
     replication amongst other blockserver nodes.


BLOCKMASTER DESIGN
++++++++++++++++++
The system is designed to have multiple blockmaster nodes in service. Metadata
is replicated via Raft consensus from the master to the other nodes.

Block Data Storage
==================
Block data is stored in a B+ tree.

Block ID
========
u32: blockmaster ID
u32: sequential record ID

Block Record
============
u8[256]: file name
u64: block id
u32[3]: replication list
u64: block checksum
----
284 bytes

New Blockmaster Join Flow
=========================
0. The parent has the new blockmaster (NBM) network address and public key
   added. The NBM is authenticated.
1. The parent process mprotect()'s the block data to RO
2. A child process is forked
3. Block data is transmitted in bulk to the NBM. 
4. Mutations to the parent block metadata are accumulated in the transaction log
5. Once the block data has been transmitted to NBM, the parent unlocks the block
   data and simultaneously applies the accumulated log differences to the local
   metadata store and replays to the NBM via log replication messages
6. After the log differences have been caught up the rest of the cluster is 
   notified of the new blockmaster
